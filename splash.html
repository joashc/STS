		<p style="text-align:justify">Sequential study designs are an important approach in pioneer (first-in-human) drug safety and effectiveness research. A sequential trial typically includes a number of stages. Each stage is defined by a pre-specified number of individuals who is exposed to a new medication or a next higher dose-level of the medication under investigation. Depending on the number of individuals who experience a certain critical (or beneficial) event at the end of a stage, the trial is either stopped for futility or proceeds with the next stage (inclusion of further individuals and re-evaluation of pre-defined stopping criteria). If a substance (or dose) successfully passes all predefined stages of the sequential trial, the medication (or dose) is claimed to be acceptably safe and/or efficient. The project targets the development of a tool (online GUI / app) which allows the visualisation of the stochastic properties of an arbitrary sequential study which will help investigators to design and plan first-in-human trials under simultaneous consideration of patient safety and overall cost-effectiveness of the investigation.</p>
